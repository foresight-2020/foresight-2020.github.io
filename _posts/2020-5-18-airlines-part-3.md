This post will be about COVID’s impact on airlines, and how we should look at investing in the industry today. This post will be shorter than usual, reflecting the fact that the more I’ve learned about the industry, the more I’ve realized that I don’t really have a truly differentiated viewpoint given the ample information that is already out there.

Buffett said it well during the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting on May 2. He invested based on the “consolidation” thesis in U.S. airlines, betting that an industry picture in which four airlines control 80% of the revenue passenger miles flown in the U.S. would continue to hold up, and therefore pricing would remain rational. There is no question at this point that this thesis no longer holds water, and that what it took was one major industry shock (which, incidentally, tends to come around every few years, whether it is the Gulf War, 9/11, high oil prices in the mid-2000s, or the 2008 recession). As Buffett said, “the world has changed for airlines” and until traffic fully recovers (and nobody knows exactly when this will happen), we will have too many planes in the sky.

Until traffic recovers, the name of the game is survival, which means liquidity. Even with support from the U.S. government, this is not a guarantee for U.S. airlines. Boeing’s CEO just commented this week that he thinks a major U.S. airline will go bankrupt this year. CDS spreads indicate that American Airlines is most likely of the four major U.S. carriers to meet this fate.

Looking beyond survival to recovery, however, there are two factors to consider: revenue and profitability. Revenue is a function of the number of passengers and the passenger yield (fare levels). These two are usually inversely correlated, assuming capacity holds constant. If there are lots of passengers (high demand) with fixed capacity, fares go up, and if there are few passengers with lots of excess capacity, fares are depressed. It is widely accepted that until there is a vaccine, the number of passengers will remain below 2019 levels. Although airlines have cut capacity significantly this year, cuts have not matched the 90%+ decline in passenger traffic, meaning fares have been impacted. And likely, given the hypercompetitive nature of the industry, as passengers trickle back, capacity will come back faster as airlines desperately try to get planes in the air. All of this means that passenger levels and fares will remain depressed for the foreseeable future, which means that revenue will be depressed too.

On the profitability side, what does this mean? The U.S. airline industry did not achieve collective profitability until 5 years after 9/11 (even though revenue had recovered by 2004). There are arguments to be made for why this time will be better: the industry had largely consolidated pre-COVID, and demand should see a more pronounced bounce back once a vaccine is developed vs. post-9/11, when people were just scared of flying in general. There are arguments to be made on the other side too: namely, that the depth of damage from COVID-19 is far worse than what happened post-9/11, so recovery will naturally take longer too. Middle-seat empty and other load restrictions are another wildcard. All this means that I don’t know when the industry as a whole will return to profitability. However, I am fairly certain that lower cost operators will return to profitability before their high cost counterparts, for reasons explained in my [previous post](https://foresight2020.co/markets/2020/05/04/airlines-part-2/).

Some airlines, like Southwest and Ryanair, remained profitable through 9/11, SARS, Great Recession, etc. No airline will remain profitable this year. What all of this means is that in the near term, the airline industry as a whole will accumulate massive losses and debt. Airlines will continue to struggle with profitability for the next few years. And when profitability finally is achieved, it will take additional years to pay down the debt and actually return capital to shareholders. This is all not counting the possibility of some other shock a few years down the line. That’s probably at least part of the reason why Buffett sold out.

Although DCFs are almost never the right way to value an airline (far too much guesswork involved), I’ve roughly mapped out a few scenarios to illustrate what I mean. The first is American Airlines, as if COVID-19 didn’t happen and with COVID-19.

Some version of the right scenario is likely what Buffett invested based on. The simplistic assumption I used here is that American earns its 2019 EBIT - tax for the next 5 years. I then stuck a 10x multiple on 2025 earnings to arrive at an enterprise value and equity value (based on cash and debt levels as of 12/31/2019). There was clearly significant equity value in American Airlines. For reference, American's market cap is around $4B today.

Now, look at American Airlines, with COVID-19. This does not account for liquidity challenges (i.e. assumes AAL survives, which is a big if). The 2021 number is a sell-side consensus. The other numbers are not scientific at all, but I still think this is a relatively optimistic projection given the challenges I highlighted above. Nonetheless, it suffices to show how much equity value has been destroyed.

What about the low-cost carriers like Southwest and Ryanair? They will likely survive (again, see [previous post](https://foresight2020.co/markets/2020/05/04/airlines-part-2/) for insight into why), but are they mispriced right now?

These numbers are rough, but they don’t suggest a “no brainer” mispricing. Equity value is significantly impaired but not to the same degree as AAL.

Ryanair is the best-positioned of the three. Ryanair’s extremely strong liquidity position means that there is a good chance that it won’t need to borrow at all through this.

However, there again doesn’t appear to be a major mispricing relative to current market cap. Ryanair and Southwest are more expensive than other airlines, accurately reflecting their better prospects.

Overall, I haven’t invested in any airlines. I think their market value declines are reflective of the challenges they face going forward. Until valuations become more attractive or the future more clear, I am staying away.
