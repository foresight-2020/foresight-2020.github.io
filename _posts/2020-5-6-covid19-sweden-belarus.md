excerpt: <p>Sweden and Belarus are about as politically divergent as any pair of countries in Europe. However, they've both decided that the best way to handle the COVID-19 outbreak is to avoid mandatory lockdown. In this article, we explain the vastly different contexts in each country which have led to this similar approach.</p>

Even the most avid of European politics enthusiasts would be hard pressed to find similarities between Sweden and Belarus apart from cold weather and a shared love of vodka and the potato. While Sweden is enshrined by many in the American left as a prosperous socialist utopia, Belarus seems to have never left the Soviet Union, marking its 26th year under the rule of its first and only president, Mr. Alexander Lukashenko. The former is widely regarded as one of the world’s most free countries; the latter is commonly referred to as “Europe’s Last Dictatorship.”

Nevertheless, the two countries have increasingly been appearing in similar news stories these last few weeks due to their unconventional methods of handling the COVID-19 outbreak - or, rather, lack thereof. To be specific, the two countries are the only major nations in Europe to eschew mandatory social distancing measures and forced lockdowns - instead, more or less letting the virus run its natural course. That’s not to say, however, that each country’s respective motivation for doing so is identical, and, in this article, we will take a deeper dive into the two starkly different government rationales that have somehow led to more or less the same coronavirus response.

Let’s start with Sweden. Unlike in many of Europe’s capitals, life in Stockholm these days has retained some semblance of normalcy, with most schools under operation, most restaurants and bars still serving customers, and public movements largely unhindered. What gives for this situation? It’s not as if Sweden - an advanced research center home to the Nobel Institute and a rich scientific tradition - lacks the medical understanding necessary to justify social distancing measures in the wake of the coronavirus, right? It turns out that Sweden is pursuing “herd immunity,” the same strategy that the UK once promoted before taking a U-turn in the face of public backlash. Under [“herd immunity,”](https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-coronavirus-strategy-explained-culture-of-trust-and-obedience-2020-4) a country’s population would more or less develop resistance to the coronavirus once a large enough portion has developed antibodies to slow its spread.

As such, the Swedish government, while taking some precautions such as limiting gatherings of over 50 and restricting visits to elderly care centers, has largely left it to its citizens to implement social distancing, with the government issuing only recommendations. According to the official statistics, this strategy seems to be working (toward its own aims, at least), with [one study](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-herd-immunity.html) projecting that over 25% of Stockholm’s population already possesses the antibody as of May 1st. Nevertheless, perhaps as a result of its deliberately lax policies, the country has indeed seen much higher rates of both infection and deaths, as seen in the graph below:

Meanwhile, a few hundred miles away, life in Belarus during the coronavirus has continued in a manner similar to Sweden. The streets of Minsk have remained relatively busy, and the [Belarusian soccer league](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-soccer-belarus/belarus-soccer-continues-amid-virus-anxiety-and-empty-stands-idUSKCN21T0FP) has - somewhat remarkably, given its previous obscurity - attracted a following all across Europe as the continent’s only major sports league still in operation. Recently, Orthodox Easter passed with many attending church services, and the country still plans to hold its upcoming WW2 Victory Day parade, an idea long abandoned in other countries which celebrate that holiday like Russia and Ukraine. However, unlike in Sweden, this lack of social distancing does not seem to be a calculated immunological strategy, but rather a unilateral, political action by the country’s dictator, Mr. Alexander Lukashenko.

Let’s examine why it is in the interests of the Belarusian government - and, perhaps, other post-Soviet regimes with similar COVID-19 policies such as Turkmenistan and Tajikistan - to avoid imposing quarantine measures of their populations. A physically imposing man, Mr. Lukashenko has cultivated much of his reputation as a “tough guy” in Belarus - often appearing in military gear, for example, or in exhibition hockey games - and this image seems to be a key component of his popularity. His blunt public [responses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/world/europe/belarus-lukashenko-coronavirus.html) to the coronavirus, such as “there are no viruses here. Do you see any of them flying around? I don’t see them either,” and “no one has died from coronavirus, everyone is dying from chronic illnesses because all viruses strike those who are weak and have no immunity,” seem to be intended to maintain such a “strongman” persona.

This public relations effort comes at a particularly sensitive time for Mr. Lukashenko, who faces re-election in August 2020. Although elections in Belarus are tightly controlled and by no means free, turnout still matters in order to justify the regime’s legitimacy, and thus the dictator still intends on providing an impetus for the population to vote. With Belarus already in a precarious financial position as a result of recent energy disputes with Russia, Mr. Lukashenko seems to have reckoned that any economic downturn that Belarus might suffer as a result of a lockdown might affect the possibility of his re-election more than a coronavirus outbreak; having thus decided not to pursue any lockdown, he is using his “tough guy” language to justify his new policy.

Nevertheless, with cases in Belarus still growing at a rate higher than its neighbors, this posturing by Lukashenko seems to have fallen flat, with Belarussians increasingly blaming his well-known eccentricities for the expanding outbreak in their country. A chemistry lecturer at Belarus State University, Yuri Adamovich, [states](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/world/europe/belarus-lukashenko-coronavirus.html), for example, that “there is reality and then there are the words of the president,” and an exiled opposition leader, Pavel Marinich, has said that “the whole world is laughing at us but it’s not healthy laughter because people are dying … \[Lukashenko\] went crazy.” There is outrage at the lack of respect that Mr. Lukashenko has shown the country’s dead and the lack of sympathy that he has shown its immunocompromised, and polls have shown that, even before the start of the outbreak, [over 70%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/coronavirus-is-spreading-rapidly-in-belarus-but-its-leader-still-denies-theres-a-problem/2020/05/01/a2532ba0-8964-11ea-80df-d24b35a568ae_story.html) of the population disagrees with his handling of the virus, instead advocating for closures and lockdown.

It is indeed fascinating that two drastically different political cultures have more or less resulted in the same coronavirus handling strategy. As the rest of the world prepares to emerge from lockdown, we should look to Sweden and Belarus for examples of how the virus spreads under less severe measures, and also how citizens implement social distancing when not legally compelled to do so. It sure does seem that the trajectories of the outbreak over the next few weeks in these two countries have the potential to forecast many such trends across the world.
