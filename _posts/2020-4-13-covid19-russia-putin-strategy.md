It would be an understatement to say that World War II remains important for Russian society. As the Russians call it, this Великая Отечественная Война - “The Great Patriotic War” - is, in the eyes of many, the watershed moment of the country’s 20th century history already filled with countless other events of world significance. Every year, on May 9th, the Russian people commemorate the anniversary of the German surrender, and the capstone of this celebration is a military parade in Moscow headlined by the “Immortal Regiment,” the march of the descendants of the 27 million Soviet citizens who perished in the conflict. 75 years after 1945, the 2020 “Victory Day” parade was shaping up to be a massive spectacle and preparations had been underway for months - that is, until the coronavirus reached Russia.

On April 11th, the Russian state media outlet TASS [hinted](https://tass.com/russia/1143497) that the celebrations might be delayed to some date after May 9th, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stating that “I do not know whether that will be on May 9 or later, but they will be held definitely as the importance of the Victory Day means the importance of the history for us." To me, the fact that the Russian government is even considering delaying such a momentous celebration underscores the vast threat the COVID-19 pandemic poses to Russia, and specifically the regime of its longtime president, Vladimir Putin.

No analysis of Russian politics is complete without an analysis of the motivations of its larger-than-life leader, who has served as president since 1999, save a four year-stint from 2008 to 2012 as prime minister under Dmitry Medvedev. With Mr. Putin’s current and second consecutive term expiring in 2024, many analysts have speculated as to how the leader will maintain power after he is constitutionally barred from running for president for a third time in a row. Perhaps he would continue to serve as chairman of the influential Security Council of Russia - just as the ex-president of neighboring Kazakhstan and close ally of Putin, Nursultan Nazerbayev, has done - or even preside over a union between Russia and its loyal neighbor Belarus. The answer seemed to emerge in the early months of 2020, when Mr. Putin proposed certain constitutional changes for a [nationwide referendum](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/world/europe/russia-putin-president-for-life.html), one of which enables him to seek two more six-year terms as president.

With the referendum originally scheduled for April 22nd now delayed indefinitely due to the growing COVID-19 outbreak in Russia, one of Mr. Putin’s current priorities must be the maintenance of a high approval rating in order for his constitutional changes to pass. Let’s examine his ratings over the last two years:

<iframe title="Percentage of Russians Approving of Vladimir Putin, 2018 - Present" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-yvS7x" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yvS7x/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();
</script>

In this chart, we can see that his approval ratings have been on a downward trend for the last two years since June 2018, [when the Russian government raised retirement ages](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45342721) for men by 5 years and for women by 8 years, sparking large protests all over the country and causing Mr. Putin’s approval rating to drop 12 points from 79% to 67% in merely two months. Now, from March 2020 onwards, we can observe another 6 point drop in ratings from 69% to 63%, potentially correlated with the coronavirus.

As such, we can hypothesize that Mr. Putin, recognizing that the current pandemic might jeopardize his political future, has factored his own approval ratings into the policies enacted by the Russian government regarding COVID-19.

Let’s start with the simple data itself reported by the Russian government on coronavirus cases and testing. The following graph shows the trajectory of the coronavirus outbreak in various countries normalized by population size:

<iframe title="Total COVID-19 Cases per 1000 People in Various Countries by the Nth Day of Outbreak*" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-EwjdE" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EwjdE/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();
</script>

At first glance, the outbreak in Russia seems far less severe than in many of the other countries. This trend deserves a closer examination, though, given the country's long border with China and large numbers of its citizens traveling frequently to highly-affected countries in Western Europe. Not to mention, the Russian government only issued substantial social distancing measures on March 25th, 2020 - at a significantly later stage of the outbreak than other countries. Therefore, there’s no reason to conclude that the spread of the virus in Russia has naturally been more limited than in other nations.

Under this assumption, there are two possible explanations for Russia’s low proportion of coronavirus cases - either its testing efforts are not pervasive enough (i.e., not enough people are being tested), or its tests are not sensitive enough (i.e., some of those who have the disease are testing negative). Therefore, our next step will be to examine some data on testing in Russia and the same countries as above. Although Russia’s testing efforts are not as extensive as Germany’s or Italy’s, the data does show that it is conducting tests at a rate in the same order as the testing efforts of more severely affected countries:

<iframe title="Total COVID-19 Tests Conducted (per 1000 people) in Various Countries" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-ukG8Q" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ukG8Q/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="294"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();
</script>

Therefore, the problem must lie not with pervasiveness of testing but rather sensitivity. Indeed, some [reports](https://pcr.news/stati/test-na-koronavirus-dlya-rossii/) indicate that Russia’s coronavirus tests are less sensitive than other tests, producing false negatives, especially for early-stage and recovering patients. [Particular concern has been raised](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-putin/2020/03/24/18917ca8-6d00-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html) about the sensitivity of the tests analyzed by the state-run VECTOR Institute located outside of the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, which, until late March, was the only laboratory conducting tests in Russia.

Why, however, are Russia’s tests less sensitive? To me, there’s no reason that the VECTOR Institute, a world-class biomedical research facility, would be unable to design a reliable coronavirus test from the data shared by the WHO and other affected countries. One explanation could be purposeful suppression of positive test results by the government, a hypothesis supported by VECTOR’s status as a state research facility and the strict restrictions placed on testing in Russia. By understating the true number of positive cases in Russia, Mr. Putin can advance his own political aims by lessening the relative magnitude of the coronavirus crisis and thus also the negative impact on his approval ratings.

Although our data itself does not decisively prove such a dire scenario, I believe that the trends indicated above certainly illustrate its potential viability. Furthermore, the idea has [gained traction](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/world/europe/coronavirus-russia-moscow-putin.html) recently both in and out of Russia. Last week, a letter circulated around Russian medical circles and signed by Aleksei Khripun, the head of Moscow’s health department, points out a “very high number of false results” in testing, and the head of the Alliance of Doctors union, Anastasia Vasilieva, accused the government of miscategorizing coronavirus patients as having pneumonia.

All reports of underreporting aside, the idea that Vladimir Putin is including his own political appeal as part of Russia’s handling of the coronavirus manifests itself elsewhere. A ruler with a strong hand in all aspects of Russian politics and society, Mr. Putin has been relatively distant from Russia’s public-facing response to the crisis - rather, the local and municipal governments have led the charge. Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin has emerged as a face of the country’s containment efforts, as the city hosts a strong majority of cases in Russia and leads Russian regions in introducing harsh social distancing measures. Meanwhile, Mr. Putin is currently cloistered at his estate on Moscow’s outskirts, addressing the Russian people about the coronavirus with only high-level brush-strokes, such as when he attempted to stir up nationalistic spirit last week [by comparing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-russia-putin/invoking-medieval-invaders-putin-rallies-russians-against-coronavirus-idUSKBN21Q1WQ) the coronavirus crisis to other (and relatively obscure) external threats - the Pechenegs and Cumans - that Russia faced in its medieval infancy. By delegating the day-to-day and increasingly restrictive coronavirus policies (or at least its public-facing announcement) to local authorities, Mr. Putin has created a system to introduce the strict social distancing necessary to stop the virus’ spread without expending his political capital and potentially lowering his approval ratings in doing so.

Time will only tell what this crucial period means for Mr. Putin. Russia will emerge from this coronavirus crisis either having confirmed Mr. Putin’s status as leader-for-life, or having deposed him. Let’s not forget that another significant transition of power in Russian history, the Bolshevik October Revolution of 1917, also occurred amidst the backdrop of a national crisis: in that case, World War I. As an experienced statesman, Mr. Putin certainly realizes this - and can’t help but yearn for one more lucky stroke to cap off his twenty years’ worth.
