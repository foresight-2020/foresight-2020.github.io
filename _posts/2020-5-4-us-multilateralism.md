Ever since the 2016 presidential election, the United States has followed a markedly different style of international engagement — one characterized by unilateral action and attempts at dominance, rather than leadership, in the world order.

President Donald Trump brought to the White House not only a new style of candidate, but a new style of foreign policy as well. His “America First” outlook calls for a reevaluation of the way that the country interacts with the world. As a result of this policy, we’ve seen deteriorating relations between the US and its neighbors, a spike in tensions with China due to a trade war, threats to withdraw from NATO, a refusal to abide by the Paris Climate Accords, more votes against the US in the United Nations, and a whole host of diplomatic incidents. The United States is remaining engaged in the international system — a wholesale return to isolationism would be economically impossible — but it is doing so in an increasingly unilateral and confrontational manner.

With the rise of China and the appearance of a true global crisis in the form of COVID-19, this shift away from multilateralism is especially dangerous for the United States’ long term position in the world order.

My friend Bliss recently wrote an article about the consequences of the United States’ recent disengagement from the WHO, and one of my previous pieces highlighted some of the ways that China is seeking to exploit the lack of US leadership in this crisis in order to increase its relative power on the world stage. The US response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated yet again just how severely the Trump Administration has altered the country’s course with regard to foreign policy. In doing so, it has also revealed some of the dangers of following such a strategy.

In 1981, Charles Kinderberger wrote an article entitled “Dominance and Leadership in the International Economy.” In it, he lays out some theoretical distinctions between these two concepts, both of which represent strategic orientations that can be adopted by a major power. Although Kinderberger focuses on the distinction between these two strategies of engagement within the context of the international political economy, they can also serve as useful lenses for analyzing international relations in general.

In this case, the power in question is the United States, a nation that has held a preeminent position in the world order ever since the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union fell.

According to Kindleberger’s framework, in order to assume a position of dominance, a nation (or some other international actor) has to be powerful enough to act without regard to the interests of other nations involved in a given situation. Some examples of this in practice can be found in the Cold War, when the Soviet Union held a position of dominance over the nations of Eastern Europe. Individual countries could try to follow a course of action that the Soviets disagreed with, but they might end up being crushed by military force, as was the case with Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. In this sense, dominance involves a unilateral strategy by the dominant power that only masquerades as a multilateral one — a nation can dissent, but that doesn’t mean that the dominant power is likely to compromise or allow it to do so.

Leadership, on the other hand, must involve multilateralism. A powerful country acting as a leader still persuades other nations to act in a way they probably wouldn’t if they were truly independent. But it does so using diplomacy, compromise, demonstration of shared interests, and by providing public goods for the global community. A country adopting a leadership-based strategic orientation isn’t powerful enough to force its allies to do its bidding — and it doesn’t have to be. The multilateral approach, built upon networks of alliances, agreements, and international institutions, amplifies strategic power to address a range of crises and issues. And of course, it’s always going to constrict and restrain the leader’s options. That’s the tradeoff that we make.

The United States has certainly made the mistake of assuming a dominant strategic posture in the past, carrying out unilateral (and, in the long run, questionable) interventions against Latin American nations throughout much of the 20th century. Even the US-ordered 2003 Invasion of Iraq, as compared to the coalition effort of the Gulf War in 1990, showcases some of the ways that unilateral, dominating action can have important consequences for a country’s reputation on the world stage.

The United States is not strong enough to behave as a dominant power. Not anymore. The rise of China coupled with an increasing international opposition to ventures viewed as acts of US imperialism makes this more clear than ever before. A foreign policy built around “America First” is not the right way to ensure a position of American leadership — if we go by Kindleberger’s framework, it’s fundamentally opposed to it. But building up multilateral cooperation, engaging with international institutions, and providing public goods in trying times are.

Compromising, understanding, and trusting are not signs of weakness. Psychologists have been telling us this about interpersonal relations for years. Americans would do well to remember that it applies to international ones too.
