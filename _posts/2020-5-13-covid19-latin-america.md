The majority of Latin America has not received a great deal of media attention when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the coverage does come, it usually centers on Brazil and the controversial policies of President Jair Bolsonaro, who criticized the medical establishment in his country and downplayed concerns over the potential large-scale effects of the virus.

Brazil is an excellent case of what can happen when the head of state refuses to accept the recommendations of scientists, doctors, and public health officials. The country has seen skyrocketing infection rates and resulting death counts, and the official statistics do not even begin to cover the country’s true numbers — only hospital patients are tested in Brazil.

The situation has contributed to massive internal strife in the country, with an already polarized political playing field becoming even more explosive. President Bolsonaro even expressed his support for popular demonstrations against the social distancing and shutdown measures that state and city level officials throughout the country scrambled to enact.

Similar controversy later erupted in the U.S. when President Trump put out a series of tweets in support of protests against stay-at-home orders in a number of U.S. states. The actions of both leaders have produced considerable backlash. I recently had the privilege of speaking with Dr. Hussein Kalout, the former Secretary of Strategic Affairs for Brazil, who [lambasted](https://thewire.in/world/brazils-foreign-policy-today-is-a-violation-of-its-constitution.) Bolsonaro’s handling of the crisis as unilateral, irrational, and dangerous.[^1] Other Latin American heads of state, such as Mexican President Andrés Obrador have also drawn considerable criticism for their handling of the crisis.

Dr. Kalout has also agreed to an interview with the Foresight team which will appear online soon!

But the flare-up of internal political divisions is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to government responses. Lack of testing, insufficient supplies of personal protective equipment, and overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure unfortunately pose serious issues throughout not only Brazil, but the entirety of the Latin America region. Unsurprisingly, these same factors pose significant obstacles to reporting and gathering accurate statistics on the spread of the virus. [According to information from the Mexican Ministry of Health](https://latindispatch.com/2020/04/10/mexican-health-ministry-estimates-coronavirus-cases-top-26000/), for instance, as many as eight undetected COVID-19 infections accompany every confirmed one. Other countries may face even less accurate reporting rates, especially in remote and non-urbanized areas.

_Map of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Latin American countries. Considering that these numbers are drastically underreported for nearly every country in the region, this paints a grim picture. According to information released by the Mexican Ministry of Health, for example, an estimated 8 undetected cases accompany each confirmed case in the country.

Some nations, such as Chile, possess highly developed healthcare systems that have contributed to a relatively high recovery rate for those infected. But the majority do not. This, combined with the relatively late introduction of the virus to Latin America, will make it highly likely that the pandemic persists in the region even after countries in Europe and the United States have more or less dealt with the crisis.

In today’s globalized and interconnected world, a crisis that affects an entire region will almost never remain isolated within that region’s corner of the world. And when that crisis comes in the form of a highly infectious viral disease, the chances of preventing it from impacting other parts of the world drop to practically nil.

This is where the direct longer-term relevance of this situation to the United States comes into play. As the country hopefully makes progress towards overcoming COVID-19 within its borders, policymakers in Washington must also be mindful of the ways that an even more persistent pandemic in a region such as Latin America will have far-reaching effects in their own country. Latin America is a major trading partner to the United States and its largest source of immigration. Both of these aspects of the multidirectional U.S.-Latin America relationship must factor into long-term response and recovery efforts.

In spite of how interconnected the United States is with the other nations of the Western Hemisphere, the Trump Administration has taken fairly little action to assist in Latin America’s battles against the coronavirus. In early May, Washington pledged $73 million to relief efforts in the region. This may seem like a large sum until we put it in the context of past actions such as the Merida Initiative, which provided over $1.6 billion in assistance to Mexico in its fight against organized drug trafficking. The Mexican Drug War is certainly a pressing national-level crisis that has spillover effects for neighboring countries as well. But the U.S. government’s response to COVID-19, a crisis that affects the entire region (and really the entire world) has involved only around 4.5% of the resources provided to the fight against drug cartels in Mexico.

Even when we analyze this resource provision over a longer timeframe, the differences are stark. Our data for the Merida Initiative comes from 2007-2017, indicating an average yearly provision of around \$160 million for one country to fight organized crime. Even in terms of a single year, the current coronavirus aid allocation for the entire Latin American region is only 45.6% of the yearly funding for Mexican security forces provided by the Merida Initiative. To make matters worse, the public-health oriented funding for the former is predominantly drawn from reallocations of existing aid programs rather than new sources.

The lack of proactive assistance measures for Latin American countries dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is not particularly surprising given the current U.S. administration’s foreign policy. As we’ve discussed in previous articles, a strategy emphasizing “America First” necessarily entails a departure from multilateralism. It’s hard to position your nation as a leader on the world stage when your administration’s explicitly stated strategy is to prioritize, uncompromisingly, solely that which benefits the United States.

This failure to act as a global and regional leader has strategic consequences as well. Ever since the Great Recession, the People’s Republic of China has been rapidly expanding its economic presence in Latin America. According to the World Bank, China is now the main trading partner for a number of Latin American nations. Based on current trends, it’s likely that this number will only go up in years to come. As the United States withdraws from the international system and reorients its strategy around the principles of America First, it’s quite likely that more and more Latin American nations will turn to them as a potential global leader and a provider of public goods for the world order.

If the United States does not re-engage with the region in a productive way, one that involves assistance and reassurance without engaging in unjust exploitation, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could easily accelerate the decline of U.S. primacy in the Western Hemisphere and damage U.S.-Latin American relations for years to come.
