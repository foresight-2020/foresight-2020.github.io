From the collapse of Yugoslavia and the neighboring Soviet Union through ethnic violence to a new age of democracy and commitment to Euro-Atlantic integration, the people of the Balkans are no strangers to rapid change and turmoil.  In the past few years, there have been both democratic gains and losses within the region.  Most starkly, Serbia and Montenegro were downgraded from democracies to hybrid regimes by Freedom House in May 2020.  However, in December 2019, North Macedonia was recognized as a major candidate for The Economist’s country of the year, for changing its name to ameliorate tension with neighboring Greece.  Both North Macedonia and Albania were praised for their commitment to European Union ascension talks, and by extent, for their commitment to the establishment of the rule of law.  Similarly, Kosovo has seen both steady and positive development in its democracy over the past five years.

Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has upended world politics, and pre-existing trends have been exacerbated, while progress in the region is at risk of being lost.  The conflicts and consequences produced by the pandemic will have a deep implication on the future of democracy within the region, as countries are forced to reinvent and re-evaluate the key elements of democracy in the environment of a public health crisis with the potential to undermine public trust in pre-existing government institutions.

According to the Varieties of Democracy Institute (V-Dem), one-third of the global population lives in declining democracies, and for the first time since 2001, the majority of countries in the world are autocratic.  V-Dem recently compiled research on the effects of COVID-19 on democracy, marking several countries in the Balkans at high risk of democratic backsliding, including Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia, and Serbia.  Other Balkan countries are marked at medium risk.  To clarify, these rankings do not indicate the likelihood of a country becoming more authoritarian, but rather the potential for state capture, or the consolidation of power by political and/or business leaders who influence decision-making and make policy in self-interest.

Of course, restrictions must be put in place in order to curb the outbreak of the pandemic.  However, historically, crises have been used as an opportunity for autocrats to seize power and maintain a state of emergency indefinitely.  Furthermore, there is a difference between necessary restrictions of which the public is informed, and unnecessary, and even autocratic restrictions, of which the public is not widely aware and there is a severe penalty.

In the age of COVID-19, governments are dealing with unique crises and will be forced to answer questions they never had to deal with before.  One of these key questions is what can be done to protect democracy and maintain political efficacy in democratic institutions, while prioritizing public health.  For several countries, the pandemic has led to a direct conflict between the prioritization of public health and government transparency, along with the right to privacy and the freedom of speech.  The government of Greece has been accused of not permitting transparency in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, since the parliament has been mostly inactive since the start of the pandemic, leaving government decision-making to be made without the prior parliamentary inquiry.  A few decrees have been scrutinized as benefiting companies with ties to the ruling party.  In Montenegro, the country’s highest court will be reviewing a case against the government by a local non-governmental organization after the National Coordination Body for Infectious Diseases published the names of those ordered into self-isolation, which some have called a violation of privacy and human rights.  In Serbia, a country no longer considered a democracy by Freedom House, measures against COVID-19 included limitations on freedom of speech, such as briefly giving the Crisis Management Taskforce a monopoly on all information in regards to COVID-19 to prevent “the spread of misinformation”.  On April 1, a journalist was briefly arrested and detained due to the new measure and over her criticism of a hospital and its lack of protection for nurses.  After public outcry, the new measure was withdrawn.

In addition to the struggle, or sometimes, the lack of will, to balance restrictions while protecting democratic norms, several countries in the Balkans have been forced to delay elections, including Serbia and North Macedonia.  Free and fair elections are a key component of democracy and help the people to feel confident in their ability to influence their government and therefore consolidate democratic institutions.  However, in this environment, it is not always safe to hold elections without precautions.

The elections in Serbia before the pandemic were already favorable to the ruling party.  President Aleksandar Vučić has been the only real contender because opposition parties are boycotting the polls, not believing in their validity.  Independent reports indicate that the state is autocratizing, no longer considered a democracy by Freedom House, and that this process has been intensified by the pandemic.  According to the Balkan Insight, observers believe that President Vučić is striving to boost turnout to legitimize the upcoming elections.  While the elections in Serbia will be non-competitive, turnout will be an issue in most democracies as governments hope to maintain political efficacy.  In addition to turnout, campaigning will be an issue without the traditional in-person alternatives.  Due to quarantine, digital democracy is faced with rapid ongoing development in a climate of fake news, and political parties must efficiently continue their campaigns in this environment with reduced in-person events.  Two countries, North Macedonia and Kosovo, have undergone rapid political change in the past few months and are affected by the lack of elections.  While there were no planned elections in Kosovo, the government of Prime Minister Albin Kurti was ended by a no-confidence vote in March, after Kurti dismissed his interior minister in a conflict related to setting up guidelines in combating COVID-19.  However, a new government was recently put in place after the Constitutional Court ruled that the president could give a mandate to form a new government without new elections, which the former Deputy Prime Minister called “state capture”.

In North Macedonia, parliament has been dissolved since February 12 in anticipation of elections before the outbreak of COVID-19, leaving the government to rely on decrees like in Greece, which has had a mostly inactive parliament.  The current Macedonian government is an unelected caretaker government, formed after Prime Minister Zoran Zaev resigned in January and called snap elections due to the failure to begin European Union (EU) membership talks after France initially blocked accession talks, supported by the Netherlands and Denmark, for both North Macedonia and Albania in October 2019.  The caretaker government is a formal component of the Pržino Agreement, in which elections in North Macedonia are organized by a bipartisan government in order to ensure fair elections.  The delayed elections were originally set for April, however, according to the Macedonian Constitution, elections may only be held 14 days after the conclusion of a state of an emergency.  However, the government is intent on holding elections, and recent developments, such as North Macedonia’s ascension to NATO and the beginning of negotiations with the EU have changed the political landscape along with the ongoing pandemic.  Though, for North Macedonia, like many countries, a balance has yet to be found between the prioritization of public health and the protection of democratic institutions.  Since March, North Macedonia has continued to be under lockdown.  Seemingly, in hopes of holding elections, the Macedonian government ended its mandatory curfew and several stricter measures against the spreading of COVID-19 in late May, in order to pave the way to the end of the state of emergency on May 30.  However, cases spiked up again, and went from single digit increases per day to double digit and triple digit, and the state of emergency was renewed until June 13.

Countries in the Balkans now face unique conflicts as a result of the pandemic.  The questions I mentioned throughout this article only begin to scratch at the surface of the future of democracy in the Balkans, not only during the pandemic, but also in a post-COVID-19 world.  However, these questions must be answered soon, or some crises, such as corruption, the brain drain and emigration of educated youth, and an economic recession, may be augmented.  In the future, the strength of democratic institutions in these countries will be deeply impacted by the ability of these governments to respond to COVID-19, while protecting the individual rights of citizens and not undermining the democratic process.  So far, ongoing developments in the region, and around the world, are not encouraging.
