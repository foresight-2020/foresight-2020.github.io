The day of the 2020 U.S. presidential election is still a long way off, but the COVID-19 pandemic has already left a visible impact on its trajectory. President Trump’s response to the crisis has become a major point of contention. The campaign programming of his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, has placed a great deal of attention on Trump’s perceived inability to handle the situation, contending that the current U.S. death toll of around 100,000 resulted in large part from his mismanagement. The focus of the Biden campaign’s framing centers on the Trump Administration’s dismantling of the country’s mechanisms designed to ensure pandemic preparedness, his initial denial of the severity of COVID-19, and his “unpresidential” personality.

Trump’s campaign and his supporters in the Republican Party are working hard to present an alternate narrative. In a previous article I wrote on China’s recent strategic moves, I discussed how President Trump wants to frame the COVID-19 pandemic as a war that the United States is fighting against an external enemy. The narrative places the responsibility for the global crisis on the Chinese government, presenting Beijing as a dangerous adversary whose authoritarian coverup of the initial outbreak and manipulation of international organizations such as the WHO put U.S. lives and U.S. sovereignty in danger. And, of course, it presents Donald Trump as the right man for the job – one that supposedly requires being “tough on China.”

It’s hard to forecast which one of these narratives will persuade more potential voters come November. A host of other factors, such as the pace of economic recovery, will play an important role in determining the final outcome of the race.

One thing is for certain: this year, the Trump Administration faces an unprecedented crisis that has ended hundreds of thousands of American lives and disrupted hundreds of millions more. Perception of the President’s handling of the crisis and its effects on the U.S. as a whole will certainly divide along largely partisan lines, but we can still gain some valuable insight for how it might affect Trump’s approval by analyzing it in the context of other recent crisis situations.

The following graph uses an aggregated set of survey data taken from polls of likely or registered voters in the United States to estimate President Trump’s approval rating over the first 1,222 days of his presidency. It’s important to keep in mind that this only measures the approval rating among the set of U.S. citizens who (most likely) have the ability to cast a vote on November 3rd.

The graph as a whole shows a fairly stable average approval rating throughout Trump’s presidency so far, fluctuating mostly around the low to mid 40s in terms of percentage. His disapproval rating, for the vast majority of his first term, has been higher, hovering mostly around the mid to low 50s.

Looking more closely at the rightmost section of the graph gives us a bit of insight into the time period in which COVID-19 began to dominate the headlines. Somewhat surprisingly, there are no huge spikes or drops, especially compared to the impact that we see when looking at the effects of other crises on presidential approval ratings.

This could be a result of COVID-19 being a fairly “slow-moving” crisis as opposed to a sudden blow such as a terrorist attack. With more time to adjust to the situation, surveyed U.S. voters might have more time to fit their reactions to the crisis into their existing ideological mindset. But over time, the effects of COVID-19 and its disruption to daily life could still drag Trump’s aggregate approval down. This would be supported by the most recent data visible in the graph – if we focus on the net approval fluctuations in the months of April and May as the crisis has dragged on, the trend definitely does not look favorable for the President. But many states are reopening and life, in some ways, is returning to some semblance of normalcy for many Americans. If the “slow-moving crisis” hypothesis is correct, then the net approval trend in months to come will depend on whether this so-called return to normal offsets the catastrophic human cost in the minds of potential voters.

Another possibility is that the positive effects of a rally-round-the-flag effect for Trump’s approval ratings have offset the negative effects of his perceived mismanagement of the crisis. If this is true, then popular opinion on the subject would most likely become even more divided along partisan lines, with Republican voters galvanized by Trump’s resistance to an external threat and Democratic ones incensed by unnecessary lost lives. The net effect in terms of overall approval would be relatively small as both sides dug in. If this hypothesis is true, a major variable in the equation will be whether or not new evidence about the virus’ origins implicates the Chinese government. The Republican Party’s electoral strategy for 2020 will work more effectively if U.S. voters’ views towards China become more militant.

For context, this next graph puts Trump’s numbers up against the last Republican to hold the office. This graph is presented in terms of aggregate net approval, with George W. Bush’s estimate in gray and Trump’s in purple for each day since the start of their respective first terms. Notice the huge spike just past the 200th day of Bush’s first term. This is probably the clearest example in recent history of the rally-round-the-flag effect in action, where the President’s approval ratings skyrocketed immediately after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. But even outside of these circumstances, Bush’s aggregate approval rating never dropped as low as Trump’s at any point in the first 1,222 days of their respective time spent in office. President Bush was reelected (albeit narrowly) just as President Obama was four years later. At the time, Bush’s numbers were already trending downward as the 2003 invasion of Iraq quickly began to lose popularity. Trump too will face an ongoing crisis during the November 2020 election.

For additional context, the next graph shows Trump’s approval during the first 1,222 days of his presidency as compared to that of President Barack Obama.

Obama faced the fallout of the Global Financial Crisis in the first term of his presidency and had to deal with the ensuing economic difficulties of the Great Recession. This crisis could also be characterized as “slow-moving” and certainly did not trigger a rally-round-the-flag surge for the President. Nonetheless, Obama’s net approval was still significantly higher than Trump’s at this point in their respective first terms, which does not bode well for Trump’s chances in the upcoming election.

November is still about half a year away. Factors such as the nation’s economic recovery and the status of the pandemic itself will certainly play an important role in determining the outcome of the next presidential election. But understanding Biden and Trump’s preferred narratives for the crisis will give us a better idea of what hints to look out for as the year goes on. Trends in the incumbent president’s aggregate approval ratings are certainly a good place to start.
