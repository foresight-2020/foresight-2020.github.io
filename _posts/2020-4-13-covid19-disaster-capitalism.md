The COVID-19 pandemic is the very definition of a major historical shock. It has a global scale, long-lasting ramifications, and life-altering effects for the vast majority of people around the world. Different countries have adopted different approaches to dealing with the situation, but at this point practically every single government has taken major action to combat both the immediate crisis and its long term impact.

In my last piece, I looked into some of the international dimensions of this crisis and focused on China’s strategic moves. This time, we’ll be examining more of what’s happening within the United States. More specifically, we’ll take a look at the neoliberal shock doctrine and how it might be relevant here.

The shock doctrine is (unsurprisingly) a central concept in Naomi Klein’s influential 2007 book The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism. It seeks to describe the process by which governments take advantage of crisis situations in order to implement otherwise unpopular neoliberal policies. These policies involve a calculated approach that emphasizes free market solutions, privatization of existing government services, and general deregulation of the economy.

Klein argues that a crisis situation, or a “shock” in this framework, provides the government and societal elites with an opportunity to aggressively roll back public sector social policies that the majority of the populace supports, allowing the private sector to fill the vacuum.

In many cases, the shocks in these scenarios originally stem from natural causes. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated large swathes of the US Gulf Coast, bringing particularly intense damage to New Orleans and the state of Louisiana. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster that led to the deaths of over 1,800 people, the Bush Administration embraced a set of “free market solutions” to the devastation. Indiana Representative (and current Vice President) Mike Pence chaired the House Republican Study Committee tasked with cooperating with consultants and think-tanks to construct such a plan of action.

Based on their recommendations as well as those of a number of lobbyists, President Bush refused to allow emergency funds to be used to pay the salaries of public sector workers in the most heavily affected areas. As a result, Over 3,000 teachers, public transit personnel, and other employees were laid off by the City of New Orleans, and large numbers of public housing projects were demolished even though many of them experienced relatively little damage from the storm itself. What followed was a localized neoliberal revolution. The real estate that had been occupied by the housing projects was open for business and new development. The public school system and the public transit system in the city were crippled by physical damage and staffing losses, providing an opportunity for private alternatives to move in and take their place.

Klein takes a clear stance in the book that the shock doctrine and the neoliberal ideology that it represents bring more bad than good for society, but the purpose of this analysis is not to pass judgment on this issue. Instead we want to discuss whether or not this same sort of shock doctrine is going into effect today as the world struggles with the COVID-19 pandemic. Klein and other prominent progressive thinkers are issuing warnings, but is this what we’re seeing play out at this point in the story?

Let’s examine the case of the United States under the Trump Administration.

The Trump Administration’s initial management of the crisis contributed to a state of widespread chaos and confusion throughout the country during the month of March. The overarching federal response was often incoherent. State level governments took matters into their own hands with varying results, and officials within Washington contradicted each other in their statements to the public. In addition to dismissing intelligence reports from as early as last November warning of an impending crisis, Trump attacked media coverage of the virus’ potential damage to the United States as a Democratic hoax before trying to turn the blame for the situation towards China. As lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, and travel restrictions eventually materialized, the American public remained confused and disoriented. The nation’s relatively low levels of worker protection and non-nationalized healthcare system may have contributed to this uncertainty even more.

With most of the US population more or less confined to their homes, the first act drew to a close. According to Klein’s theoretical model, the stage was set for the shock doctrine to go into action.

One place to look for such moves is the arrangement of large-scale corporate bailouts, which President Trump and many congressional Republicans originally intended to go into effect with limited oversight and far-reaching effects. The Obama Administration followed a similar plan of action in 2008 in the midst of the Great Recession, a decision that has since remained controversial on both sides of the aisle. In the current case, much of the bailout money is targeted at airlines, cruise lines, and fracking companies, corporations that the American public might otherwise be more concerned about providing with billions of dollars with limited oversight.

Another place to look is the still-developing debate over the US Postal Service. Postal Service officials have said that the agency will run out of cash to fund its operations by September if it does not receive emergency aid, but President Trump has flatly refused to approve any sort of bailout plan for the Postal Service despite his support of such initiatives for private sector corporations. USPS has struggled with financial solvency for years, so some degree of caution is certainly warranted, but a failure to assist the agency could leave private mail delivery services as the only functioning alternative. This would not only serve as an example of shock doctrine-induced disaster capitalism. If the USPS stops functioning, it could undermine efforts to ensure the accessibility of mail-in voting in upcoming elections, an issue that has become all the more important due the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Finally, President Trump has also suggested the possibility of suspending the payroll tax for the remainder of the year. On the surface, such a move would be intended to ease the pressure on businesses and prevent layoffs. It might be able to bring these results, but analysis of the historical and economic evidence yields unclear results. In addition, suspending the payroll tax could cost the government up to \$950 billion in revenue, putting programs like Social Security in a precarious funding situation. Privatizing or even eliminating this program has been openly discussed by many right-wing and centrist US politicians for some time now. A major hit to its funding could provide more opportunity to move forward with these plans.

In conclusion, it looks like we’re seeing limited but important instances of so-called disaster capitalism as of mid April. Whether more will come in the near future remains to be seen, but if Trump and other supporters of such an agenda in Washington go down that path, their decision will certainly produce far-reaching effects for major companies, the stock market, and the future prospects of millions of Americans.

It will also be interesting to see how this issue connects to the upcoming US Presidential election as the competing campaigns of Donald Trump and Joe Biden begin to evolve their approaches and trade blows with one another. Biden especially is faced with an important choice about what sort of stance he will take on the issues discussed both in this article and elsewhere. For instance, Bernie Sanders’ endorsement of his campaign could provide the impetus for a Democratic shift to the left on certain policy issues in order to mobilize Sanders supporters to vote in the general election. Among other effects, such a move would place the Biden campaign in direct opposition to any agenda of shock doctrine-induced disaster capitalism that may be unfolding in the coming months.

For now, though, we’ll just have to wait and see how closely the Trump Administration follows the playbook from Hurricane Katrina as it responds to the crisis.
