It’d be fair to say that the last few months have not been the most stable year for the Islamic Republic of Iran. Before the coronavirus arrived in February, the country had already been facing a multitude of challenges, including an economy languishing under international sanctions, high tensions with the United States, and increasing popular agitation in major urban centers. It sure didn’t help that Iran was one of the first countries outside of China to experience a major COVID-19 outbreak, which has claimed many lives in the country and has reached some of the highest echelons of the nation’s political elite. Nevertheless, as we will examine in this article, the coronavirus pandemic in Iran does not only present an isolated challenge in itself, but also threatens to aggravate some of the other issues the country faces - particularly the wave of nationwide protests and the escalation of tension with the United States.

Let’s begin with a quick overview of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The first confirmed cases in the country came on February 19th, in the holy city of Qom - a major pilgrimage center for Shi’a Islam. It is hypothesized that these initial cases arose from a merchant traveling between Qom and China. Although the number of cases multiplied to over 100 within a few days, the Iranian government initially downplayed the threat of the virus, with Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi [stating](https://iranprimer.usip.org/index.php/blog/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-strikes-iran) that "we have managed to reduce the problem to the minimum." On February 24th, however, when Harirchi appeared on Iranian television sweating and visibly sick himself - he was confirmed as testing positive for the coronavirus one day later - his assertions that [“the situation is almost stable in the country”](https://apnews.com/4fe2b4075638d59a180f354fc90caf93) increasingly became more and more dubious. International outlets began to accuse Iran of drastically underreporting the extent of its outbreak, and, even within the country, Qom lawmakers such as Ahmad Amiriabadi Farahani accused the government of a coverup, citing the number of deaths observers had noted in their city.

Over the next two months, as the virus continued to spread rapidly from Qom into Tehran and the rest of Iran, Harirchi would not be the only government official to become infected with COVID-19. By March 3rd, [over 8%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/iran-steps-up-coronavirus-efforts-as-23-mps-said-to-be-infected) of Iranian MPs had tested positive, and, since then, over 15 government members had passed away, a list headlined by Mohammed Mirmohammadi, a member of the Expediency Council which advises the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. In general, [according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), there have been over 114,000 confirmed cases and nearly 7,000 deaths as of May 14th, 2020. Faced with these numbers, the Iranian government eventually admitted to the severity of the outbreak and instituted significant lockdowns during the midst of the celebration of Nowruz, or Persian New Year.

Let’s return, however, to the initial accusations of official cover-up by the Iranian government. Why would it have any reason to downplay the threat of the virus and put its population at risk by eschewing quarantines and social distancing measures? While there are many factors behind the calculations of the Iranian government, one motivation might have been to prevent the further escalation of an ongoing wave of protests in the country. This trend of popular agitation in Iran began on November 15, 2019, when fuel prices were increased. Already suffering under a dire economic situation imposed by the American-led sanctions, the Iranian people took to the streets, and it is estimated that, by November 27th, over 200,000 individuals had joined the protests. The demonstrations quickly became violent, with protestors having attacked over 50 military and police barracks and outposts, 183 police vehicles, 731 banks, and 70 petroleum stations nationwide, [according to Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iran-protests-tehran-banks-revolutionary-guards-middle-east-a9220671.html), Iran’s Interior Minister, and, subsequently, there was an internet shutdown in the country lasting for many days. A second wave of protests began in early January after the Iranian government mistakenly shot down Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752, with multiple thousands taking to the streets in Tehran and other cities. In all, [it is estimated](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-protests-specialreport/special-report-irans-leader-ordered-crackdown-on-unrest-do-whatever-it-takes-to-end-it-idUSKBN1YR0QR) that over 1,500 protesters were killed during government crackdowns, a number informed by anonymous sources inside the Iranian government, with many thousands more having been arrested.

The harsh response to these protests illustrates the severity with which the Iran government considers the wave of discontent brewing in the country. As such, it is likely that the Iranian government gave strong thought to popular reaction when formulating its initial response to the coronavirus. Perhaps this is the reason that Iran avoided a lockdown or quarantine at the very beginning of the outbreak - because such restrictive moves would have risked enraging a population already on the brink of another wave of popular unrest. Instead, as we saw above, the Iranian government initially tried to reassure the population that the situation was under control and contained even when the virus was spreading rapidly.

Of course, with many government members infected and thousands of citizens dead, it became impossible to outright deny the severity of the nation’s outbreak. Therefore, the Iranian government took the step common to authoritarian governments of deflecting criticism from itself towards an outside actor - namely, the United States. Although Iran-US relations had always suffered since the 1979 Iranian Revolution and subsequent hostage crisis, relations have reached a particularly low point since 2018, when the White House announced its decision to withdraw from the JCPOA, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. A Persian Gulf standoff and proxy conflict throughout 2019 culminated with the January 3rd, 2020 assassination of General Qasem Soleimani, a paramilitary leader widely considered Iran’s second-most powerful figure after Ayatollah Khamenei, and the subsequent Iranian retaliatory strikes on American bases in Iraq.

As such, the Iranian government from the beginning of the pandemic sought to exploit these tensions and deflect popular criticism by blaming America for Iran’s outbreak. On February 26th, 2020, Iranian President [Hassan Rouhani](http://president.ir/en/114066) stated that “Americans and our enemies have wanted to halt our production and economic activities in this two-year (21-month) period now with their sanctions and propaganda. We must not let the United States attach a new virus to the coronavirus by stopping our social activities through tremendous fear.” On March 18th, 2020, [in his Nowruz message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qWGZc23pLU), Foreign Minister Javad Zarif decried the United States for refusing to lift its sanctions on Iran, which he claimed made it impossible for Iran to contain its coronavirus outbreak. Finally, on March 20th, 2020, Ayatollah Khamenei accused the United States of purposefully bringing the coronavirus to Iran, [stating](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-iran/irans-khamenei-rejects-u-s-help-offer-vows-to-defeat-coronavirus-idUSKBN21909Y) that "you \[America\] are accused of creating this virus… You could be giving medicines to Iran that spread the virus or cause it to remain permanently.”

Although they are certainly bluster to some degree, these moves nevertheless might exert real consequences on US-Iran tensions. On April 15th, there was an incident in the Persian Gulf involving near-collision between Iranian and US boats; subsequently, the US military declared that it would begin a policy of shooting at rapidly incoming Iranian vessels on sight. Perhaps such an escalation is indeed related to the re-emerging war of words between the Iranian government and the United States. In any case, however, the above rhetoric from Tehran regarding the coronavirus will only serve to further escalate tensions between the US and Iran and increase the already high probability of conflict in the region sparked by small miscalculations in the Persian Gulf.

There’s absolutely no doubt that the coronavirus will continue to pose a massive public health challenge to Iran, or any country in the world for that matter. However, as seen above, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to pour gasoline onto two of Iran’s greatest, pre-existing fires: popular unrest, and escalating tensions with the US. It is indeed to be hoped that, during this time of great uncertainty, the international community can foster an approach to Iran that can help the country effectively deal with its outbreak while fostering a de-escalation of rhetoric against the United States.
