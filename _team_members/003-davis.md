Davis is a junior at Harvard majoring in an interdisciplinary combination of philosophy, politics, and economics (known as Social Studies) with a secondary in another interdisciplinary combination of psychology and neuroscience (known as Mind, Brain, Behavior). His academic focus centers largely on international relations.

His interest in international affairs led him to become heavily involved in the Harvard International Relations Council, where he serves as President and CEO, and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, where he now works as a research assistant and translator. He aims to bring this perspective to the issues covered on this blog, working alongside Nihar and Bliss to create interesting content.

In the past, Davis has interned for the Ministry of Finance of Chile, crafting policy proposals for institutional modernization through the use of data-mining and artificial intelligence technology. Last year he helped to spearhead the UNESCO award-winning BonVoyage Project in Paris, which sought to prevent sexual assault and harassment on public transit. 

Some of his hobbies include Model United Nations, learning languages, and a cappella singing.
