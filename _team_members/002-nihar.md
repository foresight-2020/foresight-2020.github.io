Nihar is a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California, but he might as well have a finance double major, given the inordinate amount of his free time that he spends managing his personal investment portfolio.

Nihar has always felt that bringing a computer scientist’s quantitative, scientific approach to the field of investing could lead to better results, and it’s this interest in data-driven analysis of the markets that led him to start this blog with Bliss.

In the past, Nihar has worked as a software engineering intern at Google, as a data engineering intern at the quant hedge fund Two Sigma, and as an equity research intern at Topline Capital Management, a growth-oriented equities hedge fund in Santa Monica, CA. This summer, he’ll be interning at Instabase, a (recently crowned) unicorn startup in San Francisco that provides an “operating system for data”, primarily for financial institutions.

He also loves watching football (both USC and the Patriots) and running outdoors.
