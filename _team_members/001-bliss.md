A junior studying the unlikely combination of computer science and classical literature at Harvard University, Bliss has always revelled in making connections between different disciplines and forms of analysis. It was exactly this passion which motivated him to start this blog alongside Nihar so that he could further explore the second-order effects of the coronavirus crisis on world politics and society. At the moment, his main career trajectory lies in tech, and he’s preparing to intern this summer at Palantir Technologies after a stint as the Head of Engineering at a student-run web/mobile development agency. Nevertheless, he’s also passionate about international relations and global politics, especially relating to the Balkans and post-Soviet sphere, an interest perhaps spurred by his love of learning new languages (Hindi, Italian, Modern Greek) and extensive travel around Eastern Europe. After returning abruptly from studying Classics and political science in Athens for the semester, he looks forward to spending his quarantine reading more about economics, brushing up on his Russian, cooking new recipes, and, most importantly, contributing all these interests to data-driven and interdisciplinary posts on this blog!
