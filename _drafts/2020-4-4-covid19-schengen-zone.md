Many Europeans flipped through their calendars on March 25th, 2020 as if it were any other day. The date - the 30th anniversary of the implementation of the Schengen Area, a border-control-free travel zone spanning 26 European states - passed by without much fanfare by the very citizens from Poland to Portugal who have reaped its benefits hundreds of times. Perhaps it’s to be expected, though, when the surging coronavirus pandemic has kept millions of Europeans from even leaving their doorsteps, let alone their country’s borders.

The Schengen Area, and the 1985 Schengen Agreement which created it, constitute a major showpiece of the European integration process spurred on after the traumas of World War II. The result of decades of negotiation stemming from the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which enshrined the free movement of people as one of its famous “Four Freedoms,” its establishment is regarded as a watershed moment in the development of the European Union, and, [according to the former German interior minister Manfred Kanter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2020/mar/25/passport-controls-abolished-in-seven-european-countries-schengen-1995), “a milestone on the way to a united Europe.” From an initial group of five Western European countries, the area has since expanded to 26 states crossing the former Iron Curtain and countless other borders marked by centuries of bloodshed.

Thirty years later, it’s the reason why Germans can commute to jobs in Switzerland, Danes can drive across the Øresund Bridge to Sweden to evade alcohol taxes, and American tourists can visit Paris, Barcelona, and Rome without showing their passport even once - after clearing immigration at Charles de Gaulle airport, of course. Indeed, [according to a 2019 Eurobarometer survey](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/files/be-heard/eurobarometer/2020/plenary-insights-march-2020-2/en-plenary-insights-march-2020-2.pdf), 60% of EU citizens polled ranked “free movement of people, goods, and services” as the most positive result of the EU, with 56% also indicating that they have benefitted from decreased border controls.

Nevertheless, on March 12th, 2020, with the coronavirus surging in Italy and threatening Spain, France, and Germany, these 26 countries took on a more austere denomination: a collective spot on the list of countries restricted from travel to the United States. Given the vast amount of transatlantic travel - nearly 6,747 flights scheduled during the month after the proclamation - the idea of banning citizens of the Schengen countries from entering the United States seemed like an unprecedented step even in the context of the coronavirus crisis. Soon, however, on March 17th, the states of the Schengen Area themselves approved a plan to close all external borders, echoing similar entry bans found across the world.

Yet the impact of the ongoing pandemic on the Schengen Area has not stopped there. Many member states have taken the unprecedented step of shutting their national, internal borders even to other Schengen and EU nationals. [According to data released by Frontex](https://twitter.com/Frontex/status/1243117786047619073) (the European Border and Coast Guard Agency), all Schengen states have placed restrictions on the crossing of Schengen-internal borders (land, sea, and air), with 11 states taking the more drastic step of restricting entry to all foreign nationals. Furthermore, although the Schengen Borders Code provides member states with the right to temporarily suspend free movement across borders, only 16 of the 26 Schengen states have done so through [official process and notification](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/reintroduction-border-control_en), with the remaining 10 states (Greece, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakia, and Slovenia) doing so unilaterally, illustrating the frantic nature of the current crisis.

Let us now examine the implications of these border shutdowns, starting with the economic ramifications. It goes without saying that border restrictions will stifle an economy which holds as a basic tenet the freedom of movement for goods and labor - where German trucks can be found delivering goods as far away as Greece. This free mobility is so fundamentally ingrained within the European economy that many EU citizens have even started to commute to work in other countries. In all, [according to a 2019 report released by Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/eumove/bloc-2c.html?lang=en), over 1.3 million EU workers commute across borders, representing 0.6% of the total workforce. [One 2016 report](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/pdfscache/50943.pdf) notes that such a percentage rises even further in Slovakia, where 6.1% of citizens commute across borders, or in Luxembourg, where 42% of workers commute from France, Germany, or Belgium.

Although certain nations in the Schengen Area have introduced exceptions for cross-border commuters, the border closures are certain to adversely affect the local economies dependent on the flow of workers from abroad - namely, the construction and manufacturing industries. Furthermore, in some areas, cross-border commuters contribute heavily to the healthcare industry, with the [Wall Street Journal citing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/europe-tries-to-salvage-decades-of-integration-as-coronavirus-shuts-borders-11585301402?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4) 70% of Luxembourg hospital workers as non-residents, and the 2019 Eurostat report identifying 46% of the 48,000 Slovakian commuters into Austria as healthcare professionals; as such, one can forecast labor shortages in a healthcare industry already overwhelmed by the volume of coronavirus patients. Finally, due to the restricted movement of seasonal agricultural workers - with France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom together relying on nearly 1 million laborers from Eastern Europe to reap the year’s harvest, [according to a recent article in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/coronavirus-farm-labor-europe.html) - the supply chains supporting the European food industry will likely face disruption as well.

Beyond these economic reverberations, the Schengen border restrictions will likely strike another fatal blow to the pan-European psyche amidst an era of already-rising Euroscepticism. The past few years have seen a wave in anti-EU sentiment manifesting itself in many forms, from Brexit to the rise of populist, Eurosceptic parties such as Fidesz in Hungary and Law and Justice in Poland. As a whole, Europeans remain - for the most part - content with the European Union, with a[2019 Eurobarometer survey](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/files/be-heard/eurobarometer/2019/election2019/EB915_SP_EUROBAROMETER_POSTEE19_FIRSTRESULTS_EN.pdf) indicating 68% of EU citizens polled as agreeing that their country has benefitted from EU membership. However, in Italy, the country most affected by the current crisis, this percentage dips as low as 42%. With 60% of EU citizens pointing to free movement within the Schengen Area as the greatest benefit of the European Union, the potentially indefinite suspension of that provision - should the coronavirus remain a major force for more than just the next few months - might negatively impact approval of the institution as a whole even further.

The economic disruptions cited in the previous paragraph might also have a second-order impact on pan-European sentiment. Recently, with European economies plummeting amidst national lockdowns and border closures, debate has arisen within the bloc concerning stimulus measures. Some of the hardest hit countries - notably, Italy, Spain, and France - have pushed for the issuance of centralized debt at the EU level, an idea colloquially known as “corona bonds,” with countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria opposing the proposal. [Reports](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/economy/corona-bonds-eu/index.html) have emerged of the Italian and Spanish governments being “outraged” at the bloc’s reluctance, in a situation highly reminiscent of the stark economic policy divides among member states highlighted during the Greek debt crisis. There is great risk of widespread dissatisfaction amongst EU citizens no matter who wins the argument - either in Italy and Spain, where locals would feel snubbed by suddenly empty-handed and unempathetic neighbors to the north, or in Germany, where citizens might become weary of footing the bill for the perceived sluggish economies of Southern Europe for the second time in a decade.

In short, the closing of the Schengen borders poses many challenges to the pan-European dream at a moment when European solidarity is needed the most. The economic impacts of a prolonged border shutdown threaten to undo decades of trans-border integration and further promote the agenda of Eurosceptics across the continent. With that, I’ll leave the reader with one final question: how ironic would it be, if the final straw for free movement in Europe is the one force - a global pandemic - which thrives on open borders the most?
